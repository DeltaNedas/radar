# How to use the radar.
To access the radar, click the top dropdown button.
Search for a block you want to find in the [coral]text field[].
The [coral][] button will start a search and clear previous results.
The [coral][] button will stop searching, but keep existing results.
Next to the input field is the found blocks count, and the scan completion percentage.

# Input format
The block's name may include a team after a [coral]$[] symbol.
[stat]If specified and valid[], only blocks on this team will be found.
Example to find enemy duos: [green]duo$crux[]

# What is found
A tile's block, floor and overlay are scanned.
Ores, liquids, spawns, etc. therefore can be found.
When found, a block gets a green blip that slowly fades away, sonar style.
